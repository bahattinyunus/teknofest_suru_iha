## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email the Maintainer:** Send an email to the project lead (Bahattin Yunus Çetin).
2. **Details:** Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including how to reproduce it and its potential impact.
3. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.
4. **Disclosure:** Once the fix is deployed, we will coordinate public disclosure if necessary.

Thank you for helping keep the autonomous systems community safe.
